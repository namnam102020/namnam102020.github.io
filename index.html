		<p>We are Vancouver's cat cafe! Located downtown on the second floor of the International<br>Village Mall (aka ‘Tinseltown’ Mall) where Chinatown meets Gastown, we are partnered<br>with various rescues and shelters throughout British Columbia to host an ever-changing<br>crew of adoptable cats. We have around 20 to 25 cats in the lounge at any time, with lots of<br>kitties getting adopted and more newbies arriving each week.<br>Our cat cafe is both a temporary foster environment for rescue cats in search of their<br> forever homes, and a welcoming space for cat lovers in need of some quality kitty time.<br>Come enjoy cat-themed drinks and snacks, browse our shop full of fun meowchandise, and<br>make some new feline furriends! One of Canada’s first cat cafes, Catfe has found<br>homes for over 800 cats since opening in December 2015.<br>In fact, the cat cafe model has worked so well, that we are now in the midst of opening a<br>second Vancouver cafe — set to open in Spring 2020 — to provide a sanctuary and help<br>find homes for rabbits in need! Follow The Bunny Cafe on Facebook for updates, and keep<br>in touch with Catfe on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram for all cat-related mews!</p></div>
